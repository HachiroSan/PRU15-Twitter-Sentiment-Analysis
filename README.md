# PRU15-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## Introduction
The 2022 Malaysian general election, formally known as the 15th Malaysian general election, was held on Saturday, November 19, 2022, to elect the 222 members of the Dewan Rakyat to Malaysia's 15th Parliament. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter play an important role in electoral campaigns by reflecting information about politicians and their followers' policy preferences and opinions. Twitter now has over 500 million users, with 395 million of them being monthly active users, demonstrating the platform's global reach and potential impact. The microblogging platform allows users to share their thoughts through various content forms such as text, images, and links, as well as unidirectional and asymmetrical connections, which allow users to connect with other users without their permission. As a result, a Twitter user's network includes connections to thought leaders, influencers, celebrities, and political leaders, among others.

Major events such as politics or elections draw a lot of attention on social media, indicating that the platform has the potential to be a game changer. In recent years, studies have begun to investigate social media analytics, such as sentiment analysis, to improve electoral predictions based on seat count. Previous research, for example, proposed a new seat forecasting method based on social media analytics and accurately predicted the winner of the assembly elections. Others, such as, used sentiment analysis to assess public perceptions of politicians, lending credence to the notion that sentiment plays an important role in information dissemination on social media.

Overall, the sentiment on Twitter about the 15th General Election in Malaysia seems to be mixed. Many users are expressing excitement and anticipation for the election, with some expressing hope for a change in government. However, there are also a significant number of users expressing skepticism and distrust towards the electoral process and certain political parties. In this case, the objective is to understand the overall sentiment of Twitter users towards the 15th General Election in Malaysia. This information can be useful to understand how the public feels about the election and the different parties and candidates involved.

Drawing inspiration from above, this study aims to examine Malaysians perceptions of political discourse on Twitter during the most recent General Election (GE15), which resulted in the long-governing Barisan Nasional (The National Front) government being shockingly ousted by the opposition, a coalition of three political parties, Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope). The paper investigates the role of Twitter in textual communications using social media analytics, specifically sentiment analysis, content analysis, and descriptive statistics based on tweets written in English and Bahasa Malaysia.
